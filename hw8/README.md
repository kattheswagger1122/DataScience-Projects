# Project 8: Auto Industry and Food Industry MVP Comparison

## Introduction
Welcome to our project comparing two Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) for entry into the auto industry and food industry. In this project, we demonstrate the efficacy of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for both industries using machine learning techniques. We'll be analyzing datasets related to auto fuel efficiency and food image classification.

## Auto Industry (Part A)

### Understanding the Data
The dataset contains information about various cars including their mileage, engine specifications, and origin.

### Step 1: Range of Model Year
To find the range of model years in the dataset.

### Step 2: Creating Binary Output Variable
Creating a binary output variable based on median mileage.

### Step 3: Fitting SVM with Default Parameters
Using SVM with default parameters and linear kernel to predict high or low gas mileage.

### Step 4: Tuning SVM Parameters
Tuning SVM parameters such as cost value (C) to improve model accuracy.

### Step 5: Tuning SVM with Radial Basis Kernel
Tuning SVM with radial basis kernel and different values of gamma and cost.

### Step 6: Tuning SVM with Polynomial Kernel
Tuning SVM with polynomial kernel and different values of degree, gamma, and cost.

### Overall Observations
Discussing the observations and whether the MVP would be satisfactory for investors.

## Food Industry (Part B)

### Data Collection
Collecting food image data for training and testing the image classification model.

### Step 1: Preprocessing Data
Converting image data into numpy arrays and preparing for SVM.

### Step 2: Standardizing Data
Standardizing image data using sklearn preprocessing.

### Step 3: Fitting Polynomial SVM
Fitting a polynomial SVM on training data with default parameters.

### Step 4: Confusion Matrices and True Positive Rate
Calculating confusion matrices and true positive rate for training and test sets.

### Step 5: ROC Curve
Plotting the ROC curve for the model and discussing observations.

### Step 6: Image Classification and Analysis
Using HOG features for image classification and analyzing results.

### Conclusion
Comparing the performance of SVM models in both industries and discussing overall observations.

Happy analyzing and investing!
