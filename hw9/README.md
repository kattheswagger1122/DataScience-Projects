# Music Streaming Service - User Segmentation

## Introduction
Welcome to our music streaming service's data-driven marketing strategy initiative! In this project, we aim to enhance our advertising efforts by leveraging user segmentation based on sociodemographic and music preference data. By identifying distinct user clusters, we can tailor our advertising campaigns to better suit the preferences and behaviors of different user segments.

## Getting Started
To begin, ensure you have access to the Music dataset, which contains sociodemographic and music preference data on 4,914 users. This dataset will be used for clustering analysis to identify user segments.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE

### Setup
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook provided (`music_streaming_segmentation.ipynb`).

## Data Cleaning (Part A)
The first step involves cleaning the dataset to remove any NaN/null values and addressing any anomalies in the data. We drop rows with missing values and examine the distributions of various features such as age, gender, usage per month, etc.

## Clustering (Part B)
We employ K-means clustering to identify distinct user groups based on features such as age, annual income, usage per month, and number of days active. After standardizing the data, we determine the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method. The final model is trained with the chosen number of clusters.

## Visualizing (Part C)
To better understand the identified clusters, we utilize dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA to visualize the clusters in a 2D space. Scatter plots are generated to depict the clusters, providing insights into the distribution and separation of different user segments.

## Conclusion
By leveraging data-driven techniques such as clustering and visualization, we aim to optimize our marketing strategies by tailoring advertisements to specific user segments. This targeted approach can lead to improved engagement and customer satisfaction, ultimately driving growth and retention in our music streaming service.
